# My-first-Data-Analytics-Project
This is my very first Data Analytics project, which was done for the Data Analytcs course from CoderHouse in Argentina.
As the project was made in Argentina, all documentation is in spanish, as well the dasboard created in Power Bi.
The data set was pulled from https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/online-gaming-anxiety-data 
This dataset consists of data collected as a part of a survey among gamers worldwide. The questionnaire asked questions that psychologists generally ask people who are prone to anxiety, social phobia, and less to no life satisfaction. The questionnaire consists of several set of questions as asked as a part of psychological study. The original data was collated by Marian Sauter and Dejan Draschkow.
